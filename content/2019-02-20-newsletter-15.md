## Embedded at Rust All Hands 2019

Some members of the Embedded Working Group attended the Rust All Hands two weeks ago. There they had the chance to discuss the needs of the embedded community (as identified in [this survey]) with the different Rust teams and other WGs. Here's a summary of what was discussed:

[this survey]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/256

- "const generics"

The ability to parameterize over values, for example you could use this feature to write a fixed capacity `Vec`: `struct Vec<T, const N: usize> { buffer: [T; N], len: usize }`. There are a few compiler refactors going on that are required to land this in nightly so the status is "WIP". We'll have future meetings with the compiler team to try to identify and prioritize the parts of the feature that embedded developers need.

- `const fn` with trait bounds on stable.

For example, `impl<T> Struct<T> where T: Trait { pub const fn new() -> Self { .. } }`. A lengthy [pre-RFC discussion][const-eval#8] has concluded and a [proper RFC has been proposed][rfc2632].

[const-eval#8]: https://github.com/rust-rfcs/const-eval/pull/8
[rfc2632]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2632

- `core::mem::MaybeUninit` on stable.

The plan is to stabilize a [minimal, uncontroversial subset of the API][maybe_uninit] to make this available on stable ASAP.

[maybe_uninit]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53491#issuecomment-463753719

- `std::io` in `core` / `alloc`.

It's not possible to move `std::io::{Read,Write}` into `alloc` or `core` because the API depends on OS specific bits (e.g. `last_os_error`). An option may be to add a new set of `Read` / `Write` traits to `core`, maybe with associated error types, and then try to bridge these to `std::io::{Read,Write}` using blanket implementations / super traits, but this needs more research.

- fix [rust-lang/cargo#5730]

This bug breaks `no_std` builds that use build scripts unless the authors of the build dependencies are aware of the issue and actively work around it. The Cargo team is well aware of the problem. Unfortunately, it's hard to fix and the fix will likely be opt-in because it changes the current semantics.

[rust-lang/cargo#5730]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5730

- Stabilize RFC 2282 - ["Cargo profile dependencies"]

This feature lets you optimize dependencies when using the `dev` profile; useful to keep `dev` binaries small enough to fit in Flash without sacrificing all debuggability. A new [`build` profile][profile.build] will be added to cover the configuration of proc macros, build scripts, compiler plugins and their dependencies. The new profile solves the remaining unresolved question around RFC 2282.

["Cargo profile dependencies"]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48683
[profile.build]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6577

- Stabilize `core::arch::arm`

This module contains functions for instructions like `wfi` and `nop`, and SIMD instructions; stabilizing this removes the pressure for stable inline assembly (`asm!`). A member of the libs team is interested in this and will help us push it towards the finish line. [A PR in this space][stdsimd#557] has recently landed.

[stdsimd#557]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/stdsimd/pull/557

- Asserts in `const fn` context become compiler errors.

We understood that there are still several design / implementation issues that need to be discussed before this is stabilized, but in the meantime you can use the perma-unstable `-Z unleash-the-miri-inside-of-you` flag to do all sort of stuff in const context.

- std-aware Cargo.

[@jamesmunns] has written a [pre-rfc] for an incremental implementation of this feature based on our discussions with people from the libs and Cargo teams and the WASM WG.

[@jamesmunns]: https://github.com/jamesmunns
[pre-rfc]: https://github.com/jamesmunns/rfcs/pull/1

- Improve searching for `no_std` crates on crates.io.

The backend supports searching within a category (like the `no_std` category) but there's no UI for it right now. This and fixing a bug where searches only return items found until a exact match was found (instead of returning all relevant matches) are in the crates.io team TODO list.

- Fix: infinite loops (e.g. `loop {}`) are lowered to an abort instruction.

Ideally, this should be fixed in LLVM proper but it's hard to fix. It's possible to fix this in rustc but the fix is likely to regress the performance of `loop`s. The compiler team will follow up with two unstable flags to evaluate the (performance) impact of fixing this. The first flag applies the fix to only `loop`s in return position of divergent function and the second flag applies the fix to all `loop`s.

- Math support in core

That is `0f32.sin()` should "Just Work" in `no_std` crates. There are a few questions about how to best implement this without degrading performance of applications that link to `std` (we want those to use the arch optimized routines in e.g. glibc's libm instead of the generic Rust implementation) and we need a champion to do the research.

- Cargo build hooks

This refers to the ability to run custom code after `cargo build`. We covered use cases, their requirements and discussed the trade-offs of a more general Cargo tasks (e.g. `cargo $task`) mechanism vs a more targeted post-build script (e.g. `post-build.rs`) mechanism. Expect more news (a (pre-)RFC) from the WASM WG on this front.

- Slimmer `core::fmt`.

The current implementation of `core::fmt` uses trait objects and function pointers to make all uses of `core::fmt` fast to compile but this makes `core::fmt` impossible to inline which makes `no_std` programs that use formatting large in (binary) size. It might be possible to leverage std-aware Cargo to fix this: we could add a Cargo feature to `core` to replace the current implementation with one that's fully inlineable but as featureful as the current one -- this should produce smaller binaries.
