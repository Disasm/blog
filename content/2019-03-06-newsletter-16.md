## Highlights

- Know of something that isn't awesome in embedded Rust yet? Let us know by adding it to the [Not *Yet* Awesome Embedded Rust List][nyaer]!

- The Embedded WG continues to receive [submissions] for [the embedded showcase][showcase]. We are looking for cool embedded Rust projects (applications, not libraries or tools) with visuals (pictures or videos) that can serve as examples of what can be done in Rust.

- [42 Technology](https://www.42technology.com) [announced](https://twitter.com/42Technology/status/1099009843967471617) that they have got Rust running on the new Cortex-M33 powered [Nordic nRF9160 LTE SiP](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-cellular-IoT/nRF9160).

- [James Munns](https://twitter.com/bitshiftmask) has posted the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0VI70nY6Vo) of a [series of streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX44HkctSkTewrL9frlUz0yeKLKecebT1) developing a home wireless sensor node network. The stream focuses on teaching embedded, Rust, and IoT topics.
